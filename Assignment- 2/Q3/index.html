    <h1>Understanding Web Development</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. 
        It structures content using elements like <span class="highlight">headings</span>, paragraphs, and lists. 
        Every web page is built using <span class="highlight">HTML</span>, making it an essential skill 
        for web developers. By learning HTML, you can create simple to complex web pages. 
    </p>

    <h2>The Role of CSS</h2>
    <p>
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to design and format web pages. It controls elements 
        like <span class="highlight">color</span>, layout, and font styles. CSS enhances user experience 
        by making web pages visually appealing. Without CSS, web pages would look plain and 
        <span class="highlight">unattractive</span>. It allows for responsive designs that adjust 
        according to the screen size.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language used to add <span class="highlight">interactivity</span> 
        to web pages. It enables dynamic features like animations, form validations, and event handling. 
        With JavaScript, developers can create <span class="highlight">engaging</span> websites that 
        respond to user actions. It is widely used in modern web development alongside HTML and CSS.
